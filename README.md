## <a name="intro" id="intro"></a>Overview

**This is not the main component, but only a package with the graphics in Android format ETC2.** \
**The Baldurs-Gate-Graphical-Overhaul mod must still be downloaded for installation.**\
https://github.com/Spellhold-Studios/Baldurs-Gate-Graphical-Overhaul/releases/tag/v3.3 


## <a name="installation" id="installation"></a>Installation

#### Notes

**The BGGO-Android folder must be located in the root directory of your Baldur's Gate installation next to the BGGO directory.**  
If you start the **`setup-bggo.exe`** you will now see a second installation variant for Android.

## 

#### Windows

Baldur's Gate Graphical Overhaul for Windows is distributed as an extractable compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod archive into the folder of the game you wish to modify (*the folder which contains the "CHITIN.KEY" file*), using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a>, <a href="http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm">WinRAR</a>, or another file compression utility that handles .zip files. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: bggo folder and a setup-bggo.exe file in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-bggo.exe`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-bggo.exe`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Mac OS X

Baldur's Gate Graphical Overhaul for Mac OS X is distributed is distributed in the same compressed archive and includes a WeiDU installer.

First, extract the files from the archive into your game directory. On successful extraction, there should be a :file_folder: bggo folder, setup-bggo and setup-bggo.command files in your game folder. To install, simply double-click **`setup-bggo.command`** and follow the instructions on screen.

Run **`setup-bggo.command`** in your game folder to reinstall, un-install or otherwise change the components settings.

## 

#### Linux

Baldur's Gate Graphical Overhaul for Linux is distributed as a compressed tarball and does not include a WeiDU installer.

Extract the contents of the mod to the folder of the game you wish to modify.

Download the latest version of WeiDU for Linux from <a href="https://github.com/WeiDUorg/weidu/releases">WeiDU.org</a> and copy WeiDU and WeInstall to /usr/bin. Following that, open a terminal, **cd** to your game installation directory, run tolower and answer 'Y' to both queries. You can avoid running the second option (linux.ini) if you've already ran it once in the same directory. To save time, the archive is already tolowered, so there's no need to run the first option (lowercasing file names) either if you've extracted only this mod since the last time you lowercased file names. If you're unsure, running tolower and choosing both options is the safe bet.

To install, run **`WeInstall setup-bggo`** in your game folder. Then run **`wine BGMain.exe`** and start playing.
